### Frontend Test Assessment Project Requirements

**Title:** Frontend Test Assessment

**Technologies and Skills Required:**
- **React:** Utilize React to build the application components.
- **React-Hook:** Implement hooks to manage state and side effects within the application.
- **CSS (Tailwind is mandatory):** Use Tailwind CSS for styling the application.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript (optional but TypeScript is better):** The application can be built using JavaScript, but TypeScript is preferred for type safety and better code management.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices.

**Project Objective:**
- Mimic the Upwork signup and signin pages, providing a similar user experience and interface design.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1. **React Components:**
   - Create reusable and modular React components.
   - Implement functional components using React-Hook.

2. **State Management:**
